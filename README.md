# Amity GX - Calculator
A browser extension designed for Opera GX, made for helping with algebra.

The extension currently has two sections:
1. [The notes section](#the-notes-section)
2. [The calculator section](#the-calculator-section)

## The notes section

The notes section is a textarea for users to type notes into.
Its only meaningful qualities, at the time of writing, are:
- Being vertically resizeable.
- Horizontally scaling to fit the width of the entire panel.
- Using a monospace font so that text can be aligned across multiple lines through the use of whitespace characters like space.
